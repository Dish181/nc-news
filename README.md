# NC News Frontend

## Summary
NC News is a React App, which will allow a single hard-coded user to read and interact with a range of news articles.

The home page displays a list of articles as 'cards'. Using the filter and sorting functions below the header, you can filter the articles by topic and sort the articles based on a list of defined properties, as well as set the direction of the sort.

Clicking on an article card will navigate to the article view, where you can see the body of the article, vote, or leave a comment.
